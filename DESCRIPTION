Description: viewR lets you invoke the RStudio data viewer directly
    from a selection of piped code. This makes it easy to view the 
    current selection without having it to assign to a variable first.
    Combined with a sensible shortcut, you can seamlessly send the selected
    lines to the data viewer instead of executing them into the console.
