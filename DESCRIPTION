Description: viewR lets you invoke the RStudio data viewer directly from a
    selection of (piped) code. This makes it easy to view the current
    selection without having it to assign to a variable first. Combined
    with a sensible shortcut, you can seamlessly send the selected lines
    to the data viewer instead of executing them into the console.
